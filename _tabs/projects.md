Below are a few ongoing experiments and highlights. Most posts reference these initiatives in greater detail.

### Data & AI Platform Starter · 2024
Built a composable analytics stack that stitches together ingestion (Kafka + Debezium), transformation (dbt + Dagster), and serving (Delta tables + DuckDB). The project ships as infrastructure-as-code so that new teams can bootstrap trustworthy metrics in hours instead of weeks.

### Applied GenAI Tooling · 2024
Prototyped internal copilots that pair retrieval-augmented generation with guardrailed APIs. The stack leans on Go services, LangChain-style orchestration, and lightweight React front-ends so domain experts can review every response before it reaches customers.

### Engineering Playbooks · 2022–Present
Documented facilitation tips, Toastmasters speeches, and design-pattern walkthroughs that help teammates communicate as clearly as they code. These notes evolve into the articles you read on this site.
