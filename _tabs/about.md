Hi, I'm **Frank Tao**—a Melbourne-based data, AI, and full-stack engineer who enjoys turning vague product bets into measured outcomes. I created this site to collect thoughts, engineering write-ups, and experiments that do not fit inside a tweet.

## What I'm working on
- Designing resilient data platforms that keep analytics trustworthy as companies scale
- Prototyping AI copilots that blend Go/TypeScript backends with modern LLM workflows
- Sharing playbooks from Toastmasters and mentoring sessions so others can move faster

## Preferred stack
Python, Go, TypeScript, React, Next.js, AWS, PostgreSQL, Kafka, dbt, Dagster

## Away from the keyboard
When I'm not shipping code, you will usually find me trail running along the coast, or testing new coffee beans. If you'd like to collaborate or just say hello, the contact card on the sidebar has everything you need.
